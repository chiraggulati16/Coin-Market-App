# Getting Started

>**Note**: To get data from api you have to generate your own token from coinmarketcap website for listing and for news you have to generate token from newsdata.io

## Step 1: To get Coin Listing Data

Replace the token in header that you generated from coin market cap in api.tsx file.

## Step 2: To get News Data

Replace the token in NewsScreen.tsx file

When user scroll on the list both header and bottom tabs will show and hide according to user scroll behaviour (scroll up or scroll down) with animation.
